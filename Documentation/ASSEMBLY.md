# Assembly

## 1.0 Introduction
This guide provides detailed instructions on the assembly of a Cryologger GNSS system.

## 2.0 Bill of Materials

The components required to assemble a Cryologger GNSS system are split into two main groups: 1) those required for the assembly of the Cryologger itself (e.g., PCB, GNSS receiver, microcontroller, etc.), and 2) those related to the mounting, power and deployment of the complete system (e.g., tripod, solar panel, battery, etc.).
